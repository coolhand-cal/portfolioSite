            <h2> Welcome </h2>
            <p> Welcome! Itâ€™s a Great day to Grind. My name is Calvin Croxton. I am a work in progress, I am working to achieve progress, and I achieve progress through hard work. 
                I am located in my hometown of Baltimore Maryland. My natural ability to understand and break down systems served me well while in my career thus far. 
                I have served in leadership positions in the restaurant industry, non-profit sector, and most recently the field of mental health. Over the last ten years, I have led 
                teams ranging from 2 - 35 people of diverse backgrounds and experiences. I am known for my consistency and ability to keep a cool level head in any situation. I strive
                 to add value at all times.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am currently studying Programming in Thinkful's engineering immersion course. I am enjoying my time in this program.
                It has been the perfect opportunity at the perfect time. Also, the company has provided excellent support so that I can focus on my education. </p>
            <p>I have long had an interest in coding. I first learned in high school when a group of students formed a group to share knowledge in C and C#. I continued into college
                where I studied Simulation and Digital Entertainment and the University of Baltimore. I completed 91 credits towards my degree but did not graduate. A mix of Lack of engagement 
                and building stress from life events led me to accept a Career offer in the restaurant management field instead.</p> 
            <p> Although I did not get to fully utilize the skills I was building many surprisingly transferred over to the world of organizational theory and leadership. Like  with game design,
                it's all about building and maintaining systems, understanding various inputs and how they impact the possible outcomes, Creating engaging and effective training, debugging 
                the system when it does not function as desired, and constant improvement/iteration.  </p>
            <p>Beginning the road to mastering the ability to code through this course will be an amazing benefit. I desire to work with a awesome team of programmers to build effective interfaces and tools with real-world knowledge
                and experiences that will have an impact centered on the use and engagement of the end-user. I will g a career that will be consistently challenging and rewarding and put me in a position
                to have a positive impact on my community as I continue to grow.

                    <h3>Dom Contact List</h3>
                    <img src="images/contact.jpg" alt="contact app"/>
                    <p>Description:
                    Takes an array of contacts and displays a card for each one.
                        Allows for Contacts to be filtered by city. Allows for the deletion
                        of contact using the delete button. My approach to this project was to think about the 
                        document object model and how to find and access the right data from each element. This project would be a good use for any software that has
                        contacts or friends that users can view and edit. The end users would be every day people. One thing i learned from this project is how to target an element on the screen and then find its parent element.  </p>
                        <p>Completed using Javascript and the Document Object Model.

                    <h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3>
                    <img src="images/pomodoro.png" alt="timer"/>
                    <p>Description: A Timer for work intervals. Allows you to set a focus time and a break time. When the focus period
                        ends a sound plays and the break timer starts. When the break is over a sound plays and a new focus session begins. 
                        My approach to this project was to break the functionality down into components and focus on one at a time.This project
                         can be used by programmers to help them with focusing during coding projects. Working on this project I learned how to work with states and
                        pass the information into child components.</p>
                        <p>Completed using Javascript, React, and state management techniques.</p>

                    <h3>Local library</h3>
                    <img src="./images/library.jpg" alt="library"/>
                    <p>Description: A project that has several functions working with a dataset of books and authors. Makes use of the different array
                        functions including .map, .filter, .find, and .reduce. This project would be very useful as a foundation for an e-commerce website. 
                        Functions allow the user to find books by author or id, find the most popular books
                        and filter by return status among other things. My approach to this project was to study the datasets provided to understand how 
                        the arrays were structured and which array method would be the most effective for each function. I learned that Using the Array methods is much better than using
                        for loops when working with an array.</p><p>Completed using Javascript.</p>

                    <p>Description: My personal website. Developed using skills taught in this module and practiced during the pre-course work. My approach to this project was to first write 
                        the content using HTMl and then style it using CSS. This website is intended to be viewed by those with an interest in learning and development. Working on this project i learned how
                        to use flex box to organize my content on the screen. I look forward
                        to upgrading the website as my abilities increase.</p> <p>Completed using Html and CSS.</p>
